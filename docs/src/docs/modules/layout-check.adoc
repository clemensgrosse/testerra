= Layout Check

Layout tests always mean checking whether a GUI is designed according to the guidelines.

== Introduction

Are the position, size, color and shape of the elements correct? Are distances maintained? Perhaps even certain elements are missing? In test automation, functionality is primarily tested. Here it is actually irrelevant how a button is designed and where it is positioned. The main thing is that the element can be uniquely recognized via XPath or CSS selectors.

However, in some frontends such as content management systems with a high level of relevance to end users (certain portal solutions, shops) the management is also extremely important. However, testing this with Selenium's previous means is not in any relation between effort and benefit. Manual visual inspection is usually still the fastest way to do this.

Although, manual inspection can never be pixel-accurate. An inspection of perhaps more than 100 elements is too costly. Smaller shifts or colour deviations are easily overlooked.

At this point an automatic comparison of reference screenshots can help. This test is to be seen in addition to the functional tests, but cannot replace them. In a test case, it would also be conceivable to combine the check of function and layout.

== Description

A layout test with the Testerra utilities is actually a comparison between a reference and the actual state. This is done via the screenshot functionality of Selenium, in which both screenshots (reference and actual) are compared pixel by pixel from top to bottom. In this comparison, a third image is created in which differences (ReferencePixel != ActualPixel) are marked in red.

=== Prerequisites
The following prerequisites must be met

. Concrete execution environment: Layout tests should run in a concrete browser environment to ensure the comparability of the screenshots.
** Size of browser window: Define fixed size to exclude different sizes of the images at different VM resolutions
** Screen resolution and scaling: Make sure you have the same screen resolution and scaling on each presentation device.
//. Build Server: The library underlying ANNOTATED mode supports the operating systems
//** Windows 32 - and 64 - Bit
//** Linux Debian 32 - and 64 - Bit (glibc >= 2.15; Jenkins)
//** MacOSX (untested)

== Configuration

In order to get the layout check to work, you need at least a reference image and a place where it's located.

.test.properties
[source, properties, subs="attributes"]
----
{layoutcheck_reference_path}=src/test/resources/layout-references/{tt.browser}
{layoutcheck_reference_nametemplate}=%s.png

# Highly recommended to disable full screen for browser
{browser_maximize}=false

# Highly recommended to switch of the demo mode for layout tests
{demomode}=false
----
The directory for reference image may result in `src/test/resources/layout-references/chrome/WelcomePage.png` for example.

The comparison is generally carried out over the entire reference image. In this case, it is a prerequisite that the reference screenshot and the screenshot created during the test runtime have the same resolution (height and width are identical).

The property `{layoutcheck_pixel_rgb_deviation_percent}` controls, which color difference in percentage of a single pixel is count as a match. You can use that value to handle slightly changes in color or alpha values.

To validate the layout, you can check the whole page or a single <<GuiElements,GuiElement>>.

== Check the whole page

[source, java]
----
// 1% of the pixels are allowed to be different
float pixelDistanceToleranceThresholdPercent = 1.0;

LayoutCheck.assertScreenshot(webDriver, "WelcomePage", pixelDistanceToleranceThresholdPercent);
----

== Check a single GuiElement

To check the layout of a single GuiElement only, you can use the standard asserts implementation.

[source, java]
----
// 10% of the pixels are allowed to be different
float pixelDistanceToleranceThresholdPercent = 10.0;

guiElement.asserts().assertScreenshot("HeaderComponent", pixelDistanceToleranceThresholdPercent);
----

== Take reference screenshots on first run

When you have configured the reference screenshots location and implemented the tests, you can now set the option

[source, properties, subs="attributes"]
----
{layoutcheck_takereference}=true
----
to enable taking automatically screenshots based on the current browser and size configuration and storing them to the reference image's location.

WARNING: All concrete distance values in this {layoutcheck_takereference}-mode will return `0` (zero) and always pass the tests.
